Astro Wx is a full stack app that will provide the user with local and space weather to tell you local weather as well as provide indicators to possible space related events.  Currently the app is sourcing local weather through Open Weather Map API and pulling Space weather products from NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center(https://www.swpc.noaa.gov/content/data-access).
